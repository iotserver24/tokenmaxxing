## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @851-labs/tokenmaxxing@latest
tokenmaxxing bootstrap
```

`bootstrap` signs you in, syncs the usage already on your machine, optionally
installs automatic syncing, and opens your public profile.

## How it works

tokenmaxxing uses [ccusage](https://ccusage.com/) to read local coding-agent usage
and collects Supercharge from its own local session store. It turns that usage into daily token
and API-equivalent spend totals, then syncs those aggregates to your public profile. The leaderboard lets you compare spend or
tokens over the last 7 days, 30 days, or all time.

Sync is idempotent and profiles aggregate across devices, so you can run
`tokenmaxxing bootstrap` on every machine and sync as often as you like.

## Supported agents

- Claude Code
- OpenAI Codex
- OpenCode
- Gemini CLI
- GitHub Copilot CLI
- Hermes
- Pi
- Supercharge
- Grok Build CLI
- Amp
- Qwen Code
- Kimi
- Kilo Code
- Goose
- Droid
- Codebuff
- OpenClaw

## Usage

```bash
tokenmaxxing sync                         # Sync all local usage
tokenmaxxing sync --dry-run               # Preview exactly what would be sent
tokenmaxxing sync --since 2026-01-01      # Only sync usage on or after a date
tokenmaxxing sync --sources claude,codex  # Only sync selected agents

tokenmaxxing service install              # Sync automatically every 5 minutes
tokenmaxxing service status               # Show service health and the last run
tokenmaxxing service doctor               # Inspect auth, scheduler, locks, and logs

tokenmaxxing whoami                        # Show the signed-in account
tokenmaxxing upgrade                       # Upgrade the CLI and refresh the service
tokenmaxxing logout                        # Revoke this device's CLI token
```

The background service supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. It uses the global
`tokenmaxxing` binary and keeps itself current through the package manager that
installed the CLI when that package manager can be detected.

## Privacy

Only daily aggregates are uploaded: date, model name, agent name, token counts,
and API-equivalent cost. tokenmaxxing never uploads prompts, file paths, project
names, code, or session content. Preview the exact payload anytime with
`tokenmaxxing sync --dry-run`.

Profiles and leaderboard totals are public. Device hostnames are visible only
to you in settings and your per-device breakdown. CLI tokens do not expire
automatically; revoke one with `tokenmaxxing logout` or from
[settings](https://tokenmaxxing.sh/settings).
